Day 8/90 – Cloud Server Setup: Docker, Nginx & Web Deployment.



 Today's goal is to deploy a real web server on the cloud and learn practical server management.



What I did: 

 1.Launched an AWS EC2 instance.

 2. Connected securely using SSH.

 3. Installed and configured Nginx.

 4. Opened port 80 in the security group.

 5. Accessed the web server from my browser.

 6. Monitored live Nginx logs from the server.



Seeing my public IP load the Nginx welcome page in the browser was a great feeling. 



I also explored log monitoring using:

 - tail -f for live traffic.

- grep for filtering logs.

- Understanding HTTP status codes (200, 404).



This task helped me understand:

- How cloud servers actually work.

- How services run in production.

- Why logs are critical for debugging.

- The difference between local machine and remote server.
