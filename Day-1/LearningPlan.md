##  My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is a culture and set of practices that focus on collaboration between development and operations teams to deliver software faster, reliably, and at scale.  
Cloud provides scalable infrastructure and managed services that enable DevOps practices like automation, CI/CD, monitoring, and high availability.

Together, DevOps and Cloud help in building, deploying, and managing applications efficiently in real-world production environments.
