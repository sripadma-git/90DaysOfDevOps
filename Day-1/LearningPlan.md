# Day 01 – Introduction to DevOps and Cloud

## 📌 Task
The goal of Day 01 is to set a strong foundation for my DevOps journey by creating a clear and realistic **90-day execution plan**.  
This plan defines my understanding, motivation, goals, and consistency strategy for becoming a DevOps Engineer.

## 🧠 My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is a culture and set of practices that focus on collaboration between development and operations teams to deliver software faster, reliably, and at scale.  
Cloud provides scalable infrastructure and managed services that enable DevOps practices like automation, CI/CD, monitoring, and high availability.

Together, DevOps and Cloud help in building, deploying, and managing applications efficiently in real-world production environments.

## 🎯 Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud
- To build **industry-relevant skills** instead of only theoretical knowledge  
- To work on **real-world infrastructure and deployment problems**  
- To become **job-ready** for DevOps / Cloud Engineer roles  
- To build confidence in handling production systems
