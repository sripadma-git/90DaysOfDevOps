# Day 76 -- OpenTelemetry and Alerting
---

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Understand OpenTelemetry
Research and write notes on:

1. **What is OpenTelemetry (OTEL)?**
   - A vendor-neutral, open-source framework for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces)
   - It is not a backend -- it collects and ships data to backends like Prometheus, Jaeger, Loki, Datadog

2. **What is the OTEL Collector?**
   - A standalone service that receives, processes, and exports telemetry
   - Three components in the pipeline:
     - **Receivers** -- accept data (OTLP, Prometheus, Jaeger formats)
     - **Processors** -- transform data (batching, filtering, sampling)
     - **Exporters** -- send data to backends (Prometheus, debug console, Jaeger)

3. **What is OTLP?**
   - OpenTelemetry Protocol -- the standard wire format for sending telemetry
   - Supports gRPC (port 4317) and HTTP (port 4318)

4. **What are distributed traces?**
   - A trace tracks a single request as it travels through multiple services
   - Each step in the trace is called a **span**
   - Spans have: trace ID, span ID, parent span ID, start time, duration, attributes
   - Example: User request -> API Gateway (span 1) -> Auth Service (span 2) -> Database (span 3)

### Task 2: Add the OpenTelemetry Collector
Create the collector configuration:

```bash
mkdir -p otel-collector
```

Create `otel-collector/otel-collector-config.yml`:
```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  prometheus:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8889"
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [prometheus]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
```

**What this config does:**
- **Receivers:** Accepts OTLP data via gRPC (4317) and HTTP (4318)
- **Processors:** Batches data before exporting (reduces overhead)
- **Exporters:**
  - Metrics go to a Prometheus-compatible endpoint on port 8889 (Prometheus scrapes this)
  - Traces and logs go to debug output (console) -- in production you would send these to Jaeger or Tempo

Add the collector to your `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest
    container_name: otel-collector
    ports:
      - "4317:4317"   # OTLP gRPC
      - "4318:4318"   # OTLP HTTP
      - "8889:8889"   # Prometheus exporter
    volumes:
      - ./otel-collector/otel-collector-config.yml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Add the OTEL Collector as a Prometheus scrape target in `prometheus.yml`:
```yaml
  - job_name: "otel-collector"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["otel-collector:8889"]
```

Restart everything:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Verify the collector is running:
```bash
docker logs otel-collector 2>&1 | tail -5
```

![image](images/Task2.1.png)

Check Prometheus Targets -- you should now see `otel-collector` as UP.

### Task 3: Send Test Traces to the Collector
Send a sample OTLP trace using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4318/v1/traces \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resourceSpans": [{
      "resource": {
        "attributes": [{
          "key": "service.name",
          "value": { "stringValue": "my-test-service" }
        }]
      },
      "scopeSpans": [{
        "spans": [{
          "traceId": "5b8efff798038103d269b633813fc60c",
          "spanId": "eee19b7ec3c1b174",
          "name": "test-span",
          "kind": 1,
          "startTimeUnixNano": "1544712660000000000",
          "endTimeUnixNano": "1544712661000000000",
          "attributes": [{
            "key": "http.method",
            "value": { "stringValue": "GET" }
          },
          {
            "key": "http.status_code",
            "value": { "intValue": "200" }
          }]
        }]
      }]
    }]
  }'
```

Check the collector debug output to see the trace:
```bash
docker logs otel-collector 2>&1 | grep -A 10 "test-span"
```
![image](images/Task3.png)

You should see the span details printed to the console. In a production setup, you would send these to a trace backend like Jaeger or Grafana Tempo for storage and visualization.

**Send OTLP metrics too:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4318/v1/metrics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resourceMetrics": [{
      "resource": {
        "attributes": [{
          "key": "service.name",
          "value": { "stringValue": "my-test-service" }
        }]
      },
      "scopeMetrics": [{
        "metrics": [{
          "name": "test_requests_total",
          "sum": {
            "dataPoints": [{
              "asInt": "42",
              "startTimeUnixNano": "1544712660000000000",
              "timeUnixNano": "1544712661000000000"
            }],
            "aggregationTemporality": 2,
            "isMonotonic": true
          }
        }]
      }]
    }]
  }'
```

Now query it in Prometheus:
```promql
test_requests_total
```

![image](images/Task3.2.png)

The metric traveled: your curl command -> OTEL Collector (OTLP receiver) -> Prometheus exporter -> Prometheus scraped it. This is how OTEL bridges different telemetry formats.

### Task 4: Set Up Prometheus Alerting Rules
Alerts notify you when something is wrong. Prometheus evaluates alerting rules and fires alerts when conditions are met.

Create an alerting rules file `alert-rules.yml`:
```yaml
groups:
  - name: system-alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighCPUUsage
        expr: 100 - (avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100) > 80
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High CPU usage detected"
          description: "CPU usage has been above 80% for more than 2 minutes. Current value: {{ $value }}%"

      - alert: HighMemoryUsage
        expr: (1 - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes) * 100 > 85
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High memory usage detected"
          description: "Memory usage is above 85%. Current value: {{ $value }}%"

      - alert: ContainerDown
        expr: absent(container_last_seen{name="notes-app"})
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Container is down"
          description: "The notes-app container has not been seen for over 1 minute"

      - alert: TargetDown
        expr: up == 0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Scrape target is down"
          description: "{{ $labels.job }} target {{ $labels.instance }} is unreachable"

      - alert: HighDiskUsage
        expr: (1 - node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/"} / node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint="/"}) * 100 > 90
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Disk space running low"
          description: "Root filesystem usage is above 90%. Current value: {{ $value }}%"
```

**What each alert does:**
- `expr` -- the PromQL condition that triggers the alert
- `for` -- how long the condition must be true before firing (avoids flapping)
- `labels` -- metadata for routing (severity: warning vs critical)
- `annotations` -- human-readable description

Update `prometheus.yml` to load the rules:
```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  - /etc/prometheus/alert-rules.yml

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "prometheus"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]

  - job_name: "node-exporter"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["node-exporter:9100"]

  - job_name: "cadvisor"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["cadvisor:8080"]

  - job_name: "otel-collector"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["otel-collector:8889"]
```

Mount the rules file in `docker-compose.yml` under the Prometheus service:
```yaml
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    container_name: prometheus
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
      - ./alert-rules.yml:/etc/prometheus/alert-rules.yml
      - prometheus_data:/prometheus
    command:
      - '--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml'
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Restart Prometheus:
```bash
docker compose up -d prometheus
```

Check the rules in the Prometheus UI: go to Status > Rules. You should see all five alert rules listed.

![image](images/Task4.png)

Go to Alerts -- they should be in `inactive` state (green). If any condition is true, the alert moves to `pending`, then `firing` after the `for` duration.

![image](images/Task4.1.png)

**Test it:** Stop the notes-app container and watch the `TargetDown` alert fire:
```bash
docker compose stop notes-app
```

![image](images/Task4.2.png)

Wait 1-2 minutes, then check Alerts in the Prometheus UI. Start it back up when done:
```bash
docker compose start notes-app
```

---

### Task 5: Set Up Grafana Alerts
Grafana can also evaluate alerts and send notifications to Slack, email, PagerDuty, and more.

1. **Create a contact point:**
   - Go to Alerting > Contact points > Add contact point
   - Name: "DevOps Team"
   - Integration: Choose email (or Slack webhook if you have one)
   - For email: just enter your email address
   - Save

2. **Create an alert rule in Grafana:**
   - Go to Alerting > Alert rules > New alert rule
   - Name: "High Container Memory"
   - Query: `container_memory_usage_bytes{name="notes-app"} / 1024 / 1024`
   - Condition: IS ABOVE 100 (fire if container uses more than 100MB)
   - Evaluation: every 1m, for 2m
   - Add label: severity = warning
   - Link to the "DevOps Team" contact point
   - Save

3. **Create a notification policy:**
   - Go to Alerting > Notification policies
   - Set the default contact point to "DevOps Team"
   - Add a nested policy: match label `severity=critical` -> route to a different contact point (or the same one with different settings)

4. **View alert state:**
   - Go to Alerting > Alert rules
   - You should see your rule in Normal, Pending, or Firing state

   ![image](images/Task5.png)

**Document:** What is the difference between Prometheus alerts and Grafana alerts? When would you use each?

**Prometheus Alerts**

* Configured using YAML rule files
* Based on PromQL expressions only
* Works strictly on metric data
* Needs a separate Alertmanager for routing notifications
* Ideal for system-level monitoring (CPU, memory, latency, error rates)
* Strong choice for scalable, production infrastructure

**Grafana Alerts**

* Created through Grafana UI (no YAML required)
* Supports queries from multiple sources (Prometheus, Loki, SQL databases, etc.)
* Built-in alerting and notification handling
* Best for cross-data-source and dashboard-driven monitoring
* Easier for quick setup and visual-based alerting

### Task 6: Review the Full Stack Architecture
Your observability stack now covers all three pillars. Map out what you have built:

```
                    METRICS PIPELINE
[Node Exporter] -----> [Prometheus] -----> [Grafana Dashboards]
[cAdvisor] ----------> [Prometheus] -----> [Grafana Dashboards]
[OTEL Collector:8889]> [Prometheus] -----> [Grafana Dashboards]
                                    -----> [Alert Rules -> Notifications]

                    LOGS PIPELINE
[Docker Containers] -> [Promtail] -> [Loki] -> [Grafana Explore/Dashboards]

                    TRACES PIPELINE
[curl/App OTLP] -----> [OTEL Collector] -> [Debug Output / Future: Jaeger/Tempo]
```

**Services running:**

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Prometheus | 9090 | Metrics storage and querying |
| Node Exporter | 9100 | Host system metrics |
| cAdvisor | 8080 | Container metrics |
| Grafana | 3000 | Visualization and alerting |
| Loki | 3100 | Log storage |
| Promtail | 9080 | Log collection agent |
| OTEL Collector | 4317/4318/8889 | Telemetry collection |
| Notes App | 8000 | Sample application |

Verify all services are running:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

All 8 containers should be healthy and running.
