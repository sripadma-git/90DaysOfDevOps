Task 2: Revisit Weak Spots
Weak Spot: Shell Scripting
What I Re-learned:

Practiced writing if/elif/else and case statements for decision-making.

Reworked Schedule scripts with crontab to improve understanding.

Strengthened my basics in grep, awk, and sed for text processing.


Action Plan:

from now onwards ,I will practice shell scripting daily to build confidence and make it a habit.

Task 3: Quick-Fire Questions
Answer these from memory (no Googling). Then verify your answers:

1.What does chmod 755 script.sh do?
owner can read/write/execute, groups & others can read/execute.
2.What is the difference between a process and a service?
process is a running program instance, service is Managed long-running process controlled by systemd.
3.How do you find which process is using port 8080?
ss -tulnp | grep 8080
4.What does set -euo pipefail do in a shell script?
-e → Exit if command fails
-u → Error on undefined variables
-o pipefail → Fail if any command in pipeline fails
5.What is the difference between git reset --hard and git revert?
git reset --hard: removes commit from history
git revert: creates a new commit,that undoes previous commit.
6.What branching strategy would you recommend for a team of 5 developers shipping weekly?
Trunk-Based Development becasue it keeps things simple ,reduces merge conflicts and supports frequent releases.
7.What does git stash do and when would you use it?
temporarily saves uncommitted changes so you can switch branches without committing.
8.How do you schedule a script to run every day at 3 AM?
using crontab 0 3 * * * /path/to/script.sh
9.What is the difference between git fetch and git pull?
git fetch downloads changes without merging,while git pull fetches and merges it.
10.What is LVM and why would you use it instead of regular partitions?
LVM is a way to manage disk space more flexibly.so you can easily increase,decrease or combine disk space, without creating new instances.

Regular partitions are fixed in size and hard to change.while LVM lets you easily resize or combine disk space whenever you need.

Task 4: Organize Your Work
1.[✅] Make sure all your daily submissions (day-1 through day-27) are committed and pushed
2.[✅] Check that your git-commands.md is up to date
3.[✅] Check that your shell scripting cheat sheet is complete
4.[✅] Verify your GitHub profile and repos are clean (from Day 27)

Task 5: Teach It Back
Explain file permissions to a new Linux user
Home Door Analogy

Read (r): You can open the door and look inside.
Write (w): You can move furniture.
Execute (x): You can actually use the room — like turning on the lights and living in it.
In simple terms: Linux permissions are like house rules — they decide who can look,change or use a room.
